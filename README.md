# Tic Tac Toe
## Description
This is a simple game of Tic Tac Toe (3x3). You can play against computer supported by Minimax algorithm. The graphical interface is made with very simple tkinter library. The game is written in Python 3.12.2.
## How to run
To run the game you need to have Python 3.12.2 installed. Then you can run the game by typing in terminal:
```
python3 main.py
```
Or if you are using Windows:
```
python main.py
```
Or you can run the game by clicking on main.py file.
## How to play
Your goal is to get three of your marks in a row (horizontally, vertically or diagonally). Unfortunatelly, it's quite impossible to win against computer, but you can try. Good luck!
## Important note
The game is at very early stage of development. After playing the game, you have to close the window and run the game again to play another game. Maybe in the future I will add some kind of menu to play again without closing the window and to choose for example game difficulty.
